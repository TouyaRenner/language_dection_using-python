<p>Part I. Introduction: Health as Wholeness

    Proposition 1.0. Health can be understood as wholeness, either of the body, or of the person
    
    The etymology of the English word “health” is derived from Old English “hælþ” or wholeness. In other languages, this relation of health to wholeness or soundness is likewise present. To be whole is to be intact, to have all of the parts together, to be functioning as a thing ought, to not be missing something essential, to conform to what a thing characteristically is. If something has a purpose or end, then wholeness also entails that the thing is well-functioning. To what extent can the idea of wholeness be used to understand health?
    
    The concept of health has been subject to considerable dispute. Some of the dispute revolves around the breadth of the concept. The World Health Organization defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Many criticize this definition of health as being too broad. The criticisms of the World Health Organization’s definition of health include: that it extends beyond the purview of medicine, or expands the scope of
     Spanish “salud” and Italian “salute” derive from Latin “salūtem”, accusative singular of “salūs” related to “salvus”, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European “solh”, “whole, completed”. French “santé” derives from Latin “sānitātem”, accusative of “sānitās”, “health, soundness.” Greek “hygia” is “health, soundness.” German “gesundheit” and the related Dutch “gezondheid”, derive from Middle High German “gesunt”, from Old High German “gisunt”, from Proto-West Germanic “gasund,” a prefixed form of “sund”, from Proto-Germanic “sundaz”, from the Proto-Indo-European root “swen,” “sound.”
     The use of “health” arguably pertains principally to living things, whereas “wholeness” is often used also of things that are not living. However, even “health” is sometimes used, arguably metaphorically, of non-living things such as in expressions such as the “health of a car’s motor”, and in more ambiguous intermediate cases of corporate entities such as the “health of a community” to which we will turn further below.

     As examples, on extending beyond medicine: Breslow (1972); on expanding the scope of medicine too far: Callahan (1973); Huber et al. (2011); on extending to all well-being: Saracci (1997); Messer (2013); on providing too demanding a standard: Huber et al. (2011); Garner (1979); on there not being
    
    medicine too far; that it seems to concern all of human well-being, or provides a standard that is too demanding; that it is impossible to operationalize; that it is such that there will not be consensus on what constitutes well-being; and that it may lead to endless expansion of what are considered rights. Many thus prefer a narrower definition of health, focused principally on the body. 
    
    However, our everyday language seems to suggest uses of the word “health” that do extend beyond the health of the body. We might say, for example, “Every day he just sits in his room; he is physically healthy, but he is not a healthy person.” Here “not… healthy” is used to indicate that something is not right or whole about the person, even though his body may be intact and well-functioning.
    
    Arguably some of the disputes around health can be resolved by simply acknowledging that the word “health” is used in two related, but distinct, senses. There is a narrower conception of health that is focused on the health, or wholeness, of the body. However, there is also a broader conception of health that we might refer to as the health of the person, or the wholeness of the person. These two concepts of health are of course inter-related. As will be developed further below, the health of the person is in part constituted by the health of the body. Moreover, numerous aspects of the health of the person, such as psychological well-being, do often have effects on the health the body. The relations between health of the body and health of the person are perhaps especially complicated when it comes to questions of mental health. The relations and distinctions are also important when it comes to trying to understand the scope and limits of medicine. These issues will be discussed further in Section I.2 and I.7 below.
